# Analysis of Higher Education Statistics in Uzbekistan

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the higher education landscape in Uzbekistan. By leveraging national datasets from **stat.edu.uz**, the study identifies key trends in student demographics, institutional preferences, popular academic fields, and the growing internationalization of Uzbek universities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* 
**Excel:** Employed for data cleaning, normalization, and preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA).


* 
**Power BI:** Utilized to create interactive dashboards that visualize regional distribution and institutional shifts.



##Key Findings

Based on the analysis of the most recent national datasets, the following insights were identified:

* **Regional Distribution:** The majority of the student population originates from the **Qashqadaryo** and **Samarqand** regions, as well as **Tashkent City**.
* **Top Institutions:** The three universities with the highest student enrollment are:
1. Tashkent State University of Economics (**TSUE**)
2. International School of Finance and Technology (**ISFT**)
3. Tashkent International University of Chemistry (**Toshkent xalqaro kimyo universiteti**)


* **Institutional Shift:** **56%** of students are currently enrolled in **state universities**, while **44%** have opted for private or international institutions, reflecting a rapidly diversifying educational market.
